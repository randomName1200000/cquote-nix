Simple stock cli app, https://github.com/metiscus/cquote, the app compiles using nix but when executed, causes undefined behaviour.
!!!WARNING!!! If you run the binary you will have to kill the process via kill command. During compilation there are a lot of warnings, I fixed the compilation errors but fixing all the warning would be waaaay too much work.
